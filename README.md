# HugFaceOne
Repo with Jupyter notebooks where I take my first baby steps towards using models from Hugging Face
 
 HuggingFaceTest.ipynb is the first notebook I created. It is a simple notebook that uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to load a pre-trained model and generate text. It also contains the steps to set up the Python environment and install the necessary libraries.
